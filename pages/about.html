    <p>Hello everyone, my name is <b>Glennson Peralta</b>.</p>

    <p>
      I currently live in Las Vegas, NV but originally from the beautiful island
      of Oahu of Hawaii.
    </p>

    <p>
      I graduated this year with a
      <em
        >Bachelor's of Science in Information Technology with a specialization
        in Software Development and an emphasis on Web Development</em
      >. I am taking this course to concentrate my attention towards Front End
      Development and in the process, learn new skills to add to my tools. I
      look forward to our time together, learning, and sharing experiences.
